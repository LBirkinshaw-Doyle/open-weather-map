# Open Weather Map UK

This project was created to practice Async/Await methods with React to learn how to call APIs and use Async code. The project uses React Leaflet to render a map and then place markers with custom weather icons. There is a UK limited search function that moves the map to the place searched for. The weather icons update as the map is moved around.

## APIs

The APIs are supplied free from https://openweathermap.org/ and the project makes use of the Current Weather Data API, for weather data, and the Geocoding API, for location search functionality.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
